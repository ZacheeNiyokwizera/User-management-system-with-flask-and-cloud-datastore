        <h1>About this Flask Web App</h1>
        <p>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.</p>

        <p>
            Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn,
            and the community web page for Flask itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
            since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
            five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged.

            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
            Ipsum
